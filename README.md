<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great websites on internet but was missing this awesome MOBA website. So, I created this MOBA games website for fun and also to learn many things. This website features links to many other famous MOBA games website out there.

Here I have added the glassmorphism effect, parallax effect, signup/signin overlay function, star.js function, and carousel features too. Hope this is it but if anymore feature you think will be good then please do suggest.ðŸ˜Š

Of course, no website will serve every aspect since needs may be different from others. So I may be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by opening an issue.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project can be used as a template to make other projects or to understand some features of CSS to implement more things for others.
 
This project has many more possibilities but all are not implemented here so make one and improve it more. And always you can come and play MOBA games cause they are also a good game genre.
